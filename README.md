# mini-synth
Simple sound synthesiser using pygame and guizero

Other required modules: numpy

Development stages:

1. Make basic waveform generator with sine, triangle, sawtooth and square waves. (Done)

2. Add spaced sawtooth and pulse width control of square wave. (Done)

3. Add screen keyboard. (Done)

4.1 Make envelope shaper with controllable ADSR function to control tone amplitude.
4.2 Add tremolo (amplitude wobble) to all waveforms?

5. Add vibrato (frequency wobble) to all waveforms?

6. Make variable low-pass and high-pass filter to modify sound spectrum.

7. Low frequency oscillators for modulating other parameters.

8. White and pink noise generators, random pitch and amplitude modulation.

9. Storage and recall of synth settings (patches).

10. Ring modulator, phasing, chorus, unison, reverb?

11. Spectrum analysis and display?
